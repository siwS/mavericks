 These two are revolting #MKR #MKR2015
 #katieandnikki stop calling yourselves pretty and hot..you're not and saying it a million times doesn't make you either...STFU #MKR
 The menus look like they were made by a 5 year old little girl...in this case just the mental age of a 5 year old girl I guess #MKR
 Wish these blondes were in that How To Get Away With Murder show....#MKR
 Were butchers but can't tell red poultry is not cooked..  #salmonellaqueens #MKR
 Not dumb blondes...mmm...perhaps just delusions of adequacy? #MKR
 Stop saying dumb blondes with pretty faces as you need a pretty face to pull that off!!!! #mkr

 @mykitchenrules Elegant and beautiful?Cheap and trashy!Nothing more unattractive than girls banging on about how hot hey are. #mkr #notsassy
 Sorry #killerblondes but you are a long LONG way from refined. #mkr
 Drasko only likes his mum's hot pot
 its melting because you didnt put it in the freezer before you served it you dumb skank! #MKR
 #mkr deconstructed by girls that have deconstructed brains  ! Nearly brought up my dinner when I saw that crap on the plate
 In the words of former contestant @whatsnextjake
 I cannot stop looking at Nikki's dreadful black crooked bra #MKR #MKR2015
 Trying to find something pretty about these blonde idiots.#MKR
 I dislike Kat more than the blondes who are going to tell us they're hot another 50
 I've had better looking shits than these two! #MKR2015 #MKR #killerblondes
 @mykitchenrules Girls

 Actually Nikki really is quite good looking
 Stick to your day jobs girls #MKR
 Obviously natural blondes!! #mkr
 jus gonna say it...again....DUMB BITCH! #MKR
 Omg. All those girl teams and 2 couples. Hahaha
 WTF....#mkr the girls used bought sorbet amd that was the standout!!?? Shouldn't they be disqualified? ??
 It's Katie and Nikki to a T. In that it's trashy and cheap.nn#MKR
 I will not be using killer blondes as a hash tag! #MKR
 Shut up Katie and Nikki... That is all
 Anyone else notice that all 3 of Katie and Nikki's dishes were based on them being sluts? Sausage
 wait
 Just read the #killerblondes get through. Switching off. #MKR
 #MKR everyone under estimated us umm bitch you came second last
 Who is writing the bimbolines? #mkr
 Katie and Nikki - NSW - My Kitchen Rules nWhen Will people learn? They are not that hot. Pride always comes before a fall.
 @mykitchenrules My god.  You can't use a can opener?  Reminds me of a joke I know.  How do you know a blonde.....? #MKR
 Kim Kardashian has had marriages that didn't stretch as long as #MKR
 Sassy...? More like femme bots than killer blondes... #mkr
 How the f#*k are they models? #MKR
 @mykitchenrules #MKR The girls are bringing some Sassy-ges to the table.
 Just me
 @NewIdeamagazine
 Katie and Nikki have definitely proved they're not just dumb blondes with pretty faces. They're just dumb blondes. #mkr
 Who was responsible for convincing these girls they were so pretty? #MKR
 #mkr OH MY GAWD WE ARE LIKE SO HOT I CAN'T EVEN... http
 @mykitchenrules did you find Katie and Nikki in the line for Mt Druitt's next top model? #MKR
 Ugh these #KillerBlondes are killer boring
 @_saral93 not to mention these same girls on #MKR have super inflated egos considering they didn't cook that well and aren't very nice
 Yes
 If I hear hot pretty sassy like us one more time.. I will deconstruct.. #MKR #killerblondes
 #MKR maybe you girls should go back to cutting up cows and pigs
 nothing worse than a raw cock....oh wait....#MKR
 Guess one of em isn't too bad ;) #mkr
 That was annoying “@raachel_19
 The girls are going through this is fucked or are they sucking Colin's cock! #MKR
 These 2 delusional
 the theme for their instant restaurant appears to be barbie's dream narcissism kitchen 💋 #MKR
 The girls can cook for me anytime. Just not hot pot... or spatchcock. #MKR
 These girls are pretty...awful. #gohome #MKR
 @mykitchenrules if the vapid duo of conceit get through tonight I'm not watching again #suicideblondes #mkr
 They starting to act and look like a couple of B grade hookers to me #MKR
 Maybe the girls should have less tickets on themselves and worry about the cooking. #MKR
 “@walslab
 those blond girls make me crazy
 Catching up with #MKR. If society judges these two as pretty then I really have no friggin hope.
 If you talk the talk
 @mykitchenrules I think the pink has gone to the girls head #imbeautiful #MKR
 Think these two girls have wayyy to many tickets kn themselves #MKR  #PromoGirls #promogirls i think not
 If only this Sasquatch had wings to help these girls fly out of the whole they've dug for themselves #mkr @mykitchenrules
 Classy and elegant is one way of putting it... #mkr
 Oh yeah Colin! Smash those girls!
 Kel the butcher has never heard of these silly sausages on #mkr http
 @mykitchenrules Did Stevie Wonder choose these models? #MKR
 #MKR2015 #MKR why do they keep saying that they are so pretty
 Is #mkr sexist then? Four of the six teams in the fourth instant restaurants are an all-female team.
 #MKR anyone can cook from a can girls.
 We want everyone to know we are not just pretty faces noone said they were pretty though 😒 #MKR
 why is their whole menu dick related?!?!?! #MKR
 STOP SAYING SASS OR I WILL PUT MY FOOT UP YOUR ASS #MKR
 This is supposed to be a fucking cooking show not a bunch of faggots walking stupidly down a runway #cringeworthy #mkr
 #MKR you'd think in her downtime Annie would have paid Napoléon Perdis a visit and learnt not to use the same coloured blush as your hair...
 Kim Kardashian's husband will grow his dick back by the time this series finishes. #MKR
 What a riveting little lesson in walking the catwalk. Thanks ladies #MKR
 The missus loves #MKR if I have to watch five more minutes of these stuck up
 yeah colin would be looking for more fat in his sausage.... #MKR
 Gay fiancé is not going to cope being away from the fresh meat #MKR

 Will those killer blondes kill the whole dinner #MKR
 Aww I was looking forward to Ash and Camilla butting heads with the promo girls. The drama would've been great #mkr
 Absolutely #blondemoment #MKR
 Sorry but #JessieJ on #thevoiceau is being a real cunt. You're not all that.
 So bummed the dull chicks on #MKR are using such a great name for their restaurant. #Sassy #Iamlatetothepartytonight #IQ
 My deconstructed tart joke from the last season of #MKR http
 Kim Kardashian has had marriages that didn't stretch as long as #MKR
 Just me
 Did she really just tell them that in order to walk you just 'put one foot in front of the other'?nn#mkr http
 Who was responsible for convincing these girls they were so pretty? #MKR
 @Weeezza Gosh I dislike those two girls. They just aren't hot either. #MKR
 Katie's a fatty!! Model!!!! Hahahaha #MKR #killerblondes
 Out of the two blondes
 I've kind of missed Annie's batshit crazy weirdness #mkr
 Y'all made one point more... Calm your tits #MKR
 I don't think I can sit through any more of those blonde slags. This might be me
 #MKR The blonde in red has breeders hips in that dress. Model my arse!
 These girls are acting like they put up three good dishes! Reality check use didn't! Get off that high horse!! #mkr
 I want to see the butchered girls go up against the Texan (who has male sass) and his daughter (who is actually good looking) #MKR
 this is total  BS - I don't know if  I can stand anymore of the Butchers of Bimbo.nweaning off #MKR
 He saved them cause he wants to bang them #mkr
 It's obvious the blonde bimbos make better TV according to Channel 7. Shit cooks #mkr
 They're staying...just so that the producers can have a showdown between them and the posh bitches #mkr #bringit
 #MKR do the blondes keep pronouncing porno models incorrectly ? Actually that's harsh
 Seeing as you two think this is a modelling competition and not a cooking competition
 Do you get it
 Your sausage was a little bit short bet Colin's been told that before #MKR
 These girls should know skinny sausages are no fun at all. #mkr
 well ya standards are pretty low bitch #MKR
 Colin will save them. They're pretty blondes
 Unfortunately your sausage was a little bit short... #mkr
 @amsatweet I'm evil lol they are not models
 #Mkr I'd score the bimbos a 2 for their instant restaurant just because their personalities suck
 Sassy? Gurls you ain't sassy. More like bitchy. #MKR
 My kitchen rules or my vagina rules? #MKR http
 Katie and Nikki
 There's no real technique to the dishes being served up by these blonde bimbos on #MKR. Chuck together + hope for the best.
 That kitchen looks like they've re-enacted '2 Girls
 I've finally figured out what she models.  camel toes. #MKR http
 @amsatweet I'm evil lol they are not models
 #MKR ah girls
 Promo models are the dangle berry of the modeling world. Shit. #MKR
 We proved that we're not just pretty faces. Oh Nikki you proved that when you first appeared on TV. #mkr
 correction #MKR katie and nikki are really the dumb blonde ones
 We're not just the dumb blondes with the pretty faces you're certainly not the second part anyway #mkr
 We've proven we're not just dumb blondes and pretty faces. True
 #mkr Dumb blondes with pretty faces ? Well you got that half right girls
 Question is.... are they pretty?  #mkr
 You've just proved that you are two blondes with fucked up faces!! #MKR
 Dumb blondes with pretty faces..? #MKR
 #killerblondes more like #dumblondes #MKR
 Love a subtle menu. Sausage
 Who are the pretty girls these 2 blonde scrubbers keep talking about? #MKR
 If it's rigged like every other year the Nasty girls will get through for ratings #MKR
 #MKR #killerblondes the only way these girls are staying is if they blow every bloke in the room. So they're still in with a shot.
 I was so hoping the girls were going to pull something out. And they did
 #mkr nikki has hot teeth
 Are you kidding me? These girls on #MKR didn't cook their own tomatoes or peppers?!?
 Just want to slap the stupid out of these bimbos!!! #mkr
 7% of all hearing loss is a result of sitting in a restaurant next to a table full of women who just received dessert. #KillerBlondes #MKR
 Colin was pretty nice to the girls. Do you think he's giving them the dick? #MKR
 FFS a can opener is too technical for the skanky hoes #mkr
 These girls are fucktards!! #MKR
 Nicki explains the complexities of catwalk modelling
 We want to stay in this competition because we haven't finished telling everyone how pretty we are #mkr
 #killerblondes ?? Have the producers lost the plot or have my eyes failed? In what universe are they even remotely hot in?? #MKR
 #mkr #KillerBlondes @mykitchenrules I don't know what's bigger
 I apologise on behalf of my generation for Nikki and Katie. We aren't all so vapid. #MKR #NikkiandKatie
 When I think lemon tart
 Katie and Nikki go down. Maybe not well. But down none the less.n#mkr
 It's a deconstructed tart like us. #MKR
 Tarts for tarts ;) #mkr #mykitchenrules
 #mkr The only thing these promo girls are going be able to sell after this episode will be black hair dye #painfulmorons not #killerblondes
 I don't think any of those 3 dishes had sas they were ugly !! Just like the girls !!!  #MKR
 So I take it Katie is a plus size model right? #MKR
 These chicks promo in porn. 'Fat girls need fucking too'. #MKR
 Sassy.. More like trashy #MKR2015 #MKR
 I almost hope someone at the table mocks the #KillerBlondes because their deconstructed lemon tart looks like crap just like us #MKR
 @breeannamclovin cock for main and extra tart for pudding... Think they're trying subliminal messaging? #mkr #subtleasasledgehammer
 #mkr Perhaps if the girls had spent less time looking in & kissing mirrors and more time in preparation & cooking they'd be better off.
 #MKR2015 #MKR I don't think these girls can cook. Also pls stop the duck face
 Sassy.. More like trashy #MKR2015 #MKR
 Promo girls?! What do they promo??? Gloves and gumboots? #3outof10 #MKR #MKR2015
 Refined & pretty? Looks like something a blind kindergarten student chucked on a plate. #MKR
 Hate these blonde bitches already #MKR
 Deconstructed tart by lazy tarts  #MKR
 This desert is a hot mess...like its makers
 since when does the hill at the footy count as a catwalk? isnt that what a promo girl is
 These girls say they're butchers
 @Shaunnagh just saw your tweet on #mkr!! These bimbos should go!
 Hope the blonde cows don't make it through! #MKR
 Yeah I can't see her sporting Victoria's Secret wings anytime soon.    #mkr
 These two blondes are not skinny enough to be models.  #MKR
 Lol bitch please... #mkr
 And now for the dish that best represents the girls...... A big deconstructed TART  #MKR
 I didn't know they were models #MKR
 Its not the only thing she's done a lot of I'm guessing  #mkr
 The promo girls should be on cigarette packets smiling then everyone would quit #mkr
 #mkr pretty sure that's how all the chicks walk at Mt Druitt Westpoint
 Really bitch really? Get on the runway and back in the kitchen #MKR2015 #MKR
 Zebra undies #MKR chic in pink dress

 Oh my lord... #blondemomentforthe #KillerBlondes @mykitchenrules #MKR

 Everything is deconstructed. They're no good at erections then? #MKR
 Yes
 OMG I just knew they were dumb!!! No common sense or brains #MKR
 Will this tart be the deconstructing of the #sassy girls? @MKR_Official #MKR @TVWEEKmag
 Hahahahaha blonde moment! #mkr
 That kitchen looks like they've re-enacted '2 Girls
 Jesus how dumb can you get #mkr
 Katie & Nikki's next job will be playing people who stuff up simple tasks on Infomercials #MKR
 There just horrible #lemontarts #MKR
 #MKR Tart. Lol.
 Come on #Barbie
 @EloisePeace haha and that is all they are good at #mkr
 These girls need to go. Their vanity is making me ill. Very unattractive #mkr
 We're being punked
 Nikki's pouting is annoying me. I'm ready to wipe it off and kick her off the show! #MKR
 Deconstructed lemon tart
 #MKR Tart. Lol.

 More egos and arrogance than that pink room can handle in #MKR tonight.
 I carnt  see  the  pretty..... I think they quite ugly  ... promo making out they'll go    think it will be tony and lynne   #MKR
 I scream WHAT A DUMB CUNT at the contestants on #MKR way too much for someone who just over-salted a cucumber.
 Nikki has massive #armpitvaginas #mkr

 And for dessert
 Don't overthink it girls. Just stick out a can of cool whip and a banana. #mkr
 And for dessert
 LoL - sausage
 Better try harder blondesn#MKR
 Oh Katie and Nikki
 I think Drasco just offered Colin an old fashioned wristy  #MKR
 #mkr the only thing funnier than an upside down ice cream maker insert?  When my brother's ex wife admitted to burning water.
 Girls claiming they're hot generally have an overinflated view of themselves! #mkr
 These girls are either hand or feet models #MKR
 Katie is all sASS   #MKR
 With a bit of luck Nikki can do some promo work for a dentist and get some free whitening gel. #MKR
 Big difference between Sassy and Trashy. Sorry girls
 Already sick of hearing pretty #MKR #MKR2015
 These two need to be in the dictionary under Gen Y #mkr
 Katie's eyebrows are still terrible BTW #MKR #MKR2015
 Oh Katie and Nikki
 Who told these fucking girls they were hot #mkr #cuntofahead
 I wonder which of the blonde molls screwed Colin to get that score? Probably both. #mkr
 So Kat got a new decent hair cut then #MKR
 I was sure they'd roll Lynn out like Violet Beauregarde #mkr http
 Tonight's #MKR confirms the casting people trawl the dark depths of the seriously delusional
 @colinfassnidge you've lost yr credibility- 7 for that junk main? Marking models soft after acting tough so long? Poor show #MKR #sellingout
 @lilbeastunleash cos that's all they suck to get their jobs #MKR
 Drasko takes a peek out of the closet then Bianca pushes him back in. #MKR
 @ange_wilson @henryivpartii I mean otherwise we would be on #mkr or the like fapping on about how sassily fantabulous we are #simplygorge
 #mkr why do all these people WANT to cook for a living? Don't they realise it's another chore
 @IrinaLV143 Everybody get a little greasy on #mkr
 Dumb blondes with pretty faces? You're definitely right on one of those statements... Guess which one...  #MKR
 According to Holly from Geordie Shore
 @mykitchenrules Steve. Drasko is the male equivalent of those faux models wannabe... #MKR
 Oh look get the vacuum there's crumbs on that plate that need sucking up... Hey promo girls that's part of your job description.. #MKR
 You didn't give me a deconstructed lemon tart
 Look mum.. Left right left right.. I'm a model.. No sweetie you're a promo girl... Here's your bikini go sell some shots! #MKR
 Another fucking instant restaurant round? Fuck. #MKR
 Promo girl Katie calls her stuff spajacock and mascaronie ... Never cooked before. Why has @channel7 even picked them? #mkr
 According to Holly from Geordie Shore
 #mkr and for being blonde i give you my 6inches hey colin.     What a bullshit menu and lack of talent .
 This Colin guy is a tool... how rigged is the scoring?!! 7's for main and dessert?? How ridiculous based on past scores. #MKR
 of course they keep the girls hat cause drama could see that coming a mile off #MKR
 Colin likes moist thighs.. Preferably of the promo type... #MKR
 These girls really put the ASS in sass #mkr
 Colin says the meat in the thigh was moist & tender ??? Are you talking about the main dish or Nicki's thighs ? #MKR
 A 3 . . . suck on that whores #MKR
 You in the red dress . . . No
 Still moist and juicy... Let's take a selfie.. #MKR
 #mkr Katie & Nikki are atrocities
 Damn Kat & Andre sneak through
 Best describes Kat and Andre #mkr http
 How do you sleep at night
 Kat may be a bitch but let's be honest
 Seriously Nikki. Keep your arms down to hide the bingo wings and back flab. EEEE #mkr2015 #mkr  #mykitchenrules

 Annie looks like a mouse #mkr
 I swear to fuckin god kat and Andre are the worst ever contestants
 Go hot girls!!! #mkr
 Jeans were a bit tight tonight Andre ??? #mkr @mykitchenrules #mkr2015
 Wtf Kat and Andre are cheaters! THAT IS SO UNFAIR. THEY CANNOT GIVE SOMEONE 1. THEY SHOULD BE GONE. #mkr #katandandre #byebye #bitches
 Yup there still hot blondes #mkr
 The major coincidence in the score that Kat & Andre gave is ...that Kat recently scored 1 on her home IQ test. #mkr
 Karma will fuck you in the ass and cum all over back Kat #MKR
 MiddleInformer
 @mykitchenrules How about next season you hold off on the scores until all the teams have cooked
 Stick it up em Kat
 Kat you are a fucking cunt rash
If Kat stays
I hope these blonde girls make it thru
 In Australia
 Ahh Manu well said! Just cook good food and you'll be OK. Simples! Back in ya box bitch Kat #MKR

 Don't you dare put in the water works Kat!! You're evil!! #cuntandandre #MKR
 Why does kat always need to make big eyes? You freak me out witch #mkr
 Kat the #CuntFaceBitch #mkr lives to fight on. http
 Kind of want to jump through my TV and punch Kat in the face. Hope other contestants vote strategically for her now. #bitch #mkr
 KAT IS A FUCKING CUNT #mkr
 Quit bitching - if Kat and Andre had scored a 5 the blonde fuckwits would still have gone. Check out the other teams scoring... #mkr
 Someone get Kat a straight Jacket!! The bitch needs some time in a padded room!! #mkr
 #mkr Can someone punch that smug smirk off Kat's face please?
 This bitch has no right to talk about fair and has no right to celebrate
 @FakeToniaTodman she should be practising on her cooking skills #mkr
 The blondies eliminated ... Feckkkk #mkr
 Kat might as well go home now since she has no chance of beating the other teams #mkr
 This isn't even about the best cooking right now. Ugh.  I can't wait for things to get tougher so we can see Kat and Andre sweat. #mkr
 #mkr I want to slap that smirk off Kat's face. I know I know. Stand in line....
 Kat and Andre shouldn't be there they suck dick holes. The moles win my vote with the burnt butter icecream #mkr
 Honestly. Some of the rougher female heads on TV are compiled right here #mkr
 OH MY GOD IF KAT STAYS IN I QUIT LIFE SHE DOESNT DESERVE IT SO HARD #MKR

 So those blonde chicks are gone
 I'll say it if no one else will......that Kat needs serious medication #MKR #MKR2015
 Why does Kat have too be such a cunt? #mkr

 Kat is completely class less. #mkr
 Fuck off
 We're still two young hot blondes. Who aren't really blonde. And not that hot.n#MKR
 to be honest I would rather have had those models stay #mkr
 The promo bimbos are certainly annoying but Kat and Andre seem like truly objectionable people.. gross #mkr
 Is My Kitchen Rules about cooking or bitching? Seriously guys. #Mkr
 #mkr was not a fan of the promo girls
 Get Gordon Ramsay on there he'll sort #cuntandandre outn#mkr
 Kat is the daughter of satan #mkr
 No one even likes you Kat & Andre. You won't last long...#mkr
 Two blondes....Twitter will be the judge  of hot!n#mkr
 The other teams KNEW kat would vote strategically
 Fuck you and your strategic unfair voting! Don't like either team but at least they weren't c*nts like Kat and Andre. So disappointed. #MKR
 Kat
 Awww
 Ok so I'm not the biggest fan of The Blondes but.... Even I didn't want them to go #MKR

 @Dreysander1 Should be. I already have the advice for future college men.  Find older women OR date girls from ANY college but yours.
 @Dreysander1 The college tribunals only apply if BOTH attend that school.
 @LMargolez My Twitter account is hilarious. But I cannot take credit. The mind numbingly moronic feminist hypocrites deserve the credit.
 .@kmx1974 @Scyleet You never Googled financial abortion OR you are too dumb to comprehend otherwise you would NOT ask what you did. Which?
 @Dreysander1 Hard to say.  I naively had my fun

 @Dreysander1 Sons are at much greater risk now than daughters because of feminist laws.
 @Dreysander1 Absolutely.

 @amberhasalamb Can you explain why this is wrong? http
 @amberhasalamb I have no misogynist views.  Feminism is an ideology

 @Transic_nyc With luck

 @amberhasalamb Can you comment on Ford doing the VERY thing she complains of...? http
 @feministlah I'm looking for them...lot of hay on top of those needles.
 @amberhasalamb ...in what way?
 @amberhasalamb I didn't realize I was supposed to treat you as a child whose opinion is irrelevant

 @tsupdawgs @feministlah I'll take any screen grabs you have.  Thanks.
 @amberhasalamb  Separate conversations.  She told a guy concerned about circumcision that he can't get laid.  Exactly what she whined about.
 @hayleyjoness @Fatboyisangry1 That is feminism's doing

 @hayleyjoness Why do you judge on genitals


 @feministlah @GreenWeiner No.  Valid point.  I have never actually seen an MRA say he hates women (openly) like #KillAllMen etc.
 @hayleyjoness Curious...do you know what the 23% (pay gap) figure refers to?  Do you know how it was derived?
 @feministlah @GreenWeiner No True Scotsman.
 @feministlah @GreenWeiner ...who are mislabeled.
 @hayleyjoness YW...?  Well


 @MT8_9 @amberhasalamb My god

 @hayleyjoness ...as a result there is a POSSIBLE supply of 100% of the population for all female jobs vs. maybe 20% for some male jobs.
 @feministlah @GreenWeiner Women have more legal rights in every Western nation.  Who is privileged?
 @feministlah @GreenWeiner So feminism is NOT about equal rights

 .@feministlah @GreenWeiner Way way more than one...and why not...that's how they arrive at male privilege? #AntiSJW http
 @feministlah @GreenWeiner Picture was gender neutral

 .@feministlah @GreenWeiner I never said men didn't have privileges or that women didn't face biases

 @MT8_9 @robinashe @hayleyjoness Actually I have. The same thing happens to African Americans

 @trishesdishes Are you aware women have more

 #QuestionsForMen Did you know feminists think that violence is okay so long as the victim isn't seriously injured? http
 @trishesdishes Why ignore my question to deflect with yours?  Are you aware men have LESS legal rights?  Is that equality?
 @GreenWeiner Let's test. http
 @GreenWeiner  It's close.  Need one of those Conan O'Brien morphs of Tony and the Big Hurt.
 @boxedariel So...is the answer nothing?
 @boxedariel Can you explain the wage gap?  What does the often cited 23% figure reference?
 @boxedariel None of these things are true.  But I return to the original question...research. What have you read?
 @boxedariel Where is your knowledge of feminism derived?
 @boxedariel @LostSailorNY Can you be legally forced into parenthood?
 @boxedariel @LostSailorNY Single men cannot adopt.
 @purposelyflawed http
 @boxedariel @LostSailorNY No one said she should.
 .@trishesdishes US. Canada. UK. France. Switzerland. Germany. India. Every western nation and then some.  Men have less legal rights. Equal?
 @boxedariel @LostSailorNY If it's her choice alone...yes.  Do you oppose single mothers?
 @boxedariel @LostSailorNY She can abort. Adopt it out. Safe haven.
 @trishesdishes Go back to the top of this thread and read again
