## Google Dev Fest hackathon

For Google Dev Fest Hackathon we built a prototype that allows us to identify racist and sexist comments in Slack workspaces by using the Google Auto ML product and the Slack API. 

We also built a Conversational Chat bot using DialogueFlow to educate the person who sent the message about such matters. 

Finally using the Google Speech-to-text, we were able to parse voice and analyse for inappropriate comments, and send the same message. 

We used these 2 datasets to train our model that contained pre-classified tweets as racists, or sexists:

- https://github.com/ZeerakW/hatespeech
- https://github.com/AkshitaJha/NLP_CSS_201

## Next steps

-[ ] Get it out of POC phase.
-[ ] As workplace communications are different than twitter communications we need to expand our dataset and train our models accodingly.
-[ ] Expand to more workplace channels.
